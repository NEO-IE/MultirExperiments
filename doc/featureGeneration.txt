Takes as input : 
1. The sentence and Document
2. arg1 and 2 start and end offset
3. arg1Id and arg2Id : FreeBase


Step1:

The first step is to take up the file containing matchings and generate a list of SententialArgumentPair. A SententialArgumentPair is defined as follows : 
	    private Integer sentID;
		private Pair<Integer,Integer> arg1Offsets;
		private Pair<Integer,Integer> arg2Offsets;
		private List<String> relations;
		private String arg1ID;
		private String arg2ID;
		private String partitionID;

Note that all of this information is available in the matching file.

Step2:

Note that there could be several matchings in a sentence. The next step is to collect matchings by the sentence in which they appear. To this end, we use the following data structure to store them : 
Map<Integer,List<SententialArgumentPair>> sapMap = new HashMap<>();

This is a map from the sentence id to the list of sentential argument pairs that are there in that sentence.
